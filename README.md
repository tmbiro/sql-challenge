# sql-challenge
For this challenge, I pretended that itâ€™s been two weeks since I was hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). My first major task was to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.  For this project, I designed tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data. That is, I used SQL to perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.
